If you want to execute the code in this notebook, make sure to download these files first! (The code assumes that you've extracted the WikiPlots corpus, leaving two files in the same directory as the notebook: `titles` and `plots`. You don't need to extract the poetry corpus, as the code operates directly on the compressed file.)"
