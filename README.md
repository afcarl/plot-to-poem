# Plot to poem

Please see comments and output in [the notebook](plot-to-poem.ipynb).

Here's some sample output, using the plot of *When Harry Met Sally...*:

    Where in one dream the feverish time of youth
    Alas! that any friend of mine
    week to the 'mistress'--for women carry on the business of
    In gardens where men love me, and be sure
    Is't not enough that women toil.
    And so, in spite of all that Time is bringing,--
    There, in eegrass new a-shooten,
    But still, unmindful of time's flight,
    She is a woman: one in whom
    Among her women; certain, would not wed.
    It cannot be that you would make a prisoner of me,
    And all the maiden went in me before him,
    evening of my life; I did not think then how happy I was."
    You must try to walk sedately.
    But a night and hauf a day that I 'll leave my dearie;
    To such let others carve their way,
    Will find from year to year,
    With other friends may part:
    You know when some one went to sea--
    The milkmaid is waiting, I say, with her pail;
    That her Majesty stood in great need of a tutor,
    In conflict with her foes,
    For I have wish'd this marriage, night and day,
    As if his wrathful spite would never wake,
    Yet wist her life at last must lincke in that same knot.
    Than share the city's year forlorn.
    Who does not love his early dream of love?--
    What is there that abides
    Then may I marry you, my pretty maid?'
